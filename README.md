# Hangman-Game
 Hangman Game Description
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. The game progresses with each incorrect guess leading to a visual representation of a hangman, and the objective is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.

How to Play
Start the Game: Enter your name on the "How to Play" page and click the "Start Game" button. This will take you to the main game screen.

Guess a Letter: In the main game, you will see a series of underscores representing the letters in the hidden word. Below the underscores, enter a letter in the input box and press "Enter" or click the "Guess" button.

Feedback:

If your guess is correct, the corresponding letters in the word will be revealed.
If your guess is incorrect, the number of remaining guesses will decrease, and a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
Winning the Game: The game continues until either:

You correctly guess all the letters in the word, winning the game.
You run out of guesses (i.e., the hangman is fully drawn), leading to a game over.
Letters Guessed: You will also see a list of letters you have already guessed, helping you avoid repeating guesses.

Scoring: Your score can be based on the number of guesses left when you correctly guess the word. A higher score is achieved by guessing the word with more remaining guesses.
